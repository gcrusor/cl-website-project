    <h3>What I Do Best</h3>
    <p>I like tp speak with pad and a pen. At other times, it's a camera and lens. Grandiose eloquotion isn't quite my style. I like to present what I need to, excatly how I need, only when I need to. That said, scroll below and let the work speak for itself.</p>

    <h3>Just a Kid from Chicago...</h3>
    <p>...and now living in Louisville, KY. How did that happen? Well, that's a tome for another website. Here are the bits you might care about most:
        <ul>
            <li>South side of Chicago born and raised/South burbs raised some more</li>
            <li>Proud Bison (HU!)</li>
            <li>Seminary nerd/graduate</li>
            <li>Spent time as an online pastor</li>
            <li>Later, an employee of a couple of seminaries</li>
            <li>Traveled a ton for work and still do</li>
            <li>Been bringing life to word and images since cassette decks in cars were a thing</li>
            <li>Bulls fan no matter what city I'm in!</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Picture Me Rollin'</h3>
    <p>Digital and film, I love and shoot with both. Art with words is great but sometimes a picture says it all. When I'm behind the camera, I seek to tell the stories of life in a big city, particularly from the viewpoint of the overlooked and outcast. Allow me show you what I see.</p>

    <h3>Crystal Stairs and Whatnot</h3>
    <p>My work in both photography and poetry inform one another on the daily. Often, I'll see an image I want to create or capture and become filled with stanzas that speak to that image or an associated theme. Below are a few of my poetry books and chapbooks that give greater voice to how that process has worked in my mind to date.</p>
